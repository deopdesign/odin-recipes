    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 oz Prince® Lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 lb ground beef 2 cups pasta sauce</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pasta Preparation:</strong> Begin by cooking the Prince® Lasagna noodles as per the package instructions. Once cooked, lay them flat on a sheet of foil to cool, preventing sticking.</<li>>
      <li><strong>Meat Sauce:</strong> In a skillet, brown the ground beef. Drain the excess fat and mix in the pasta sauce.</li>
     <li> <strong>Cheese Mixture:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, one cup of mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper.</li>
     <li> <strong>Layering:</strong> In a 13x9x2-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce. Place three pasta sheets over the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the pasta, followed by another layer of meat sauce. Repeat the layers, finishing with a final layer of pasta and meat sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Touch:</strong> Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
      <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350º F. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for another 15 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
      <li><strong>Resting:</strong> Allow the lasagna to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This rest period helps the layers set, making it easier to cut and serve.</li>
