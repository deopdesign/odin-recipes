      My kids will give up a steak dinner for this spaghetti. It is a recipe I
      have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say)
      that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but
      home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this
      spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the
      recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1/2 of the sauce from
      this recipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later! Thanks to all of
      you who have tried my recipe and have written a review. I read and
      appreciate every one of them! Chef Note: After I posted this recipe I
      remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of
      wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a
      splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was
      a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped
      myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My
      husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly
      fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought
      to give his boss. Goes to show you--don't use a wine for cooking you
      wouldn't drink. You get the best results from a good wine!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2lbs Italian sausage, casings removed (mild or hot)</li>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped (optional)</li>
      <li>3 -4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1(28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2(6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
      <li>(15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
      <li>
        2 cups water (for a long period of simmering for flavors to meld. If you
        don't want to simmer it as long, add less)
      </li>
      <li>3 teaspoons basil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes</li>
      <li>1 1⁄2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1⁄4 - 1⁄2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1⁄4 teaspoon fresh coarse ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1⁄4 cup red wine</li>
      <li>1lb thin spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In large, heavy stockpot, brown Italian sausage, breaking up as you
        stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until onions are
        softened. cc
      </li>
      <li>Add garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce and water.</li>
      <li>
        Add basil, parsley, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper, and black
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Stir well and barely bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Stir in red wine.</li>
      <li>
        Simmer on low, stirring frequently for at least an hour. A longer simmer
        makes for a better sauce, just be careful not to let it burn!
      </li>
      <li>Cook spaghetti according to package directions.</li>
      <li>
        Spoon sauce over drained spaghetti noodles and sprinkle with parmesan
        cheese.
